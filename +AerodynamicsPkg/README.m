% (I) Overview
%
%       The Aerodynamics Package is used to model the aircraft using more
%       detailed aerodynamics models sourced from Aviary, NASA's latest
%       aircraft design and analysis tool. The aerodynamics models in
%       Aviary come from FLOPS, the FLight OPtimization System, previously
%       developed by NASA. The code in this package can replace the
%       constant L/D assumption in the climb, cruise, and descent segments
%       traditionally shipped with FAST.
