%
% (I) Overview
%
% The ConstraintDiagramPkg allows the user to create a constraint diagram
% given a set of FAA or user-prescribed regulations. Current FAA-supported
% regulations are within 14 CFR 25:
%
%     25.111  - Takeoff Climb
%     25.119  - Landing Climb, All Engines Operative
%     25.121a - Transition Climb
%     25.121b - Second Segment Climb
%     25.121c - Enroute Climb
%     25.121d - Landing Climb, One Engine Inoperative
%
% Other pertinent requirements exist for the takeoff/landing field length
% (JetTOFL/JetLFL), minimum approach speed (JetApp), cruise/diversion
% (JetCrs/JetDiv), and the service ceiling (JetCeil). However, these are
% not explicitly defined in 14 CFR 25, but may be necessary for sizing a
% configuration.
%
% In future releases, 14 CFR 23 regulations may be added. Alternatively,
% these can be added by someone else within the aerospace community. 
% Despite this limitation, the main function, "ConstraintDiagram", has
% already been built to accommodate additional constraint functions and
% generate diagrams for aircraft certified under 14 CFR 23.
%
% Turbofan aircraft are always certified under 14 CFR 25, and
% thrust-to-weight ratio and wing loading (T/W-W/S) diagram is created. For
% turboprop and piston aircraft, a power-to-weight ratio and wing loading
% diagram (P/W-W/S) is created if the aircraft is certified under 14 CFR
% 23. If the turboprop/piston aircraft is certified under 14 CFR 25, a
% power loading and wing loading diagram (W/P-W/S) is created.
%
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% (II) Using this Package
%
% First, create a Constraint Specification File. Examples are included in
% the "+ConstraintSpecsPkg" and include both turbofan and turboprop
% aircraft certified by 14 CFR 25. A comprehensive list of the possible
% input parameters is provided in Section III. The actual input parameters
% needed depend on the requirements used for the analysis. Please consult
% each constraint function for the necessary parameters that must be input
% to execute the code accordingly.
%
% Second, run the "ConstraintDiagram" function. This involves inputting the
% aircraft model made in the previous step. In the example files, the
% function is called within the Constraint Specification File (for
% convenience). However, it can be called elsewhere, or embedded in another
% piece of code. (We keep it in the Constraint Specification File so that
% we can plot the sizing point from literature in red.)
%
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% (III) Inputs Used by +ConstraintSpecsPkg
%
% The constraint specification files in "+ConstraintSpecsPkg" use the
% following fields in the "Aircraft.Specs" data structure, where "Aircraft"
% is the name of the overarching data structure. Each specification may
% not use each field.
